# Business Analysis Overview

- **Goal:** Automate the creation and maintenance of Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) to improve architectural traceability, consistency, and decision quality. Reduce manual effort and average ticket handle time for architecture-related queries by 30%.
- **Scope:** 
  - Automate drafting, validation, and lifecycle management of ADRs using signals from emails, chat, meetings, issue trackers, PRs, and RFCs.
  - Output ADRs in MADR format with strict section adherence.
  - Support C4 diagram generation and GitHub workflow integration (branching, PRs, tagging).
  - Read-only for existing ADRs; never overwrite, only supersede.
- **Stakeholders:** Architecture Team, Engineering, Compliance, Security, DevOps.
- **Success Metrics:** 
  - ≥95% ADRs pass validation (drivers, options, decision, consequence, traceability).
  - Average ADR drafting time reduced by 50%.
  - CSAT ≥ 4.6/5 for architecture team.
  - p95 ADR automation latency ≤ 2 minutes.
- **Risks:** 
  - Incomplete or ambiguous source signals.
  - PII or secret leakage in ADRs.
  - Non-compliance with MADR rigor.
  - Policy drift or untracked supersessions.
- **Mitigations:** 
  - Explicit gap indication and user clarification workflow.
  - Guardrail prompts and NFR enforcement.
  - Automated validation and weekly audits.
  - Incident triage and rollback workflow.
