Feature: ADR Automation Agent – Architectural Decision Record Automation
  As an architect or engineer
  I want the ADR Automation Agent to automate the drafting, validation, and management of ADRs
  So that architectural decisions are consistently documented, traceable, and compliant with standards

  Background:
    Given the agent is configured with access to signals from emails, chats, meetings, issue trackers, PRs, and RFCs
    And the agent is integrated with GitHub workflows for ADR management
    And the agent enforces MADR format and section requirements

  Scenario: Automated ADR drafting from multiple signals
    Given relevant architectural discussions and decisions exist in source systems
    When the agent detects a new architectural decision
    Then the agent should draft a new ADR in MADR format
    And include drivers, options, decision, consequences, and traceability to source signals

  Scenario: ADR validation for completeness and compliance
    Given an ADR is drafted by the agent
    When the agent validates the ADR
    Then the ADR must include all required MADR sections
    And pass automated completeness and traceability checks

  Scenario: Privacy and security enforcement
    Given the agent drafts or updates an ADR
    When the ADR contains PII or secrets
    Then the agent must redact sensitive data
    And refuse to publish non-compliant ADRs

  Scenario: GitHub workflow integration
    Given an ADR is ready for review
    When the agent submits the ADR
    Then the agent should create a new branch and pull request
    And tag the ADR appropriately
    And never overwrite existing ADRs, only supersede if needed

  Scenario: Traceability and supersession
    Given an ADR supersedes a previous decision
    When the agent creates the new ADR
    Then the agent must link to the superseded ADR
    And maintain a clear decision lineage

  Scenario: Risk mitigation and auditability
    Given weekly audits are scheduled
    When the agent detects policy drift or compliance issues
    Then the agent should flag incidents for triage
    And support rollback workflows if required

  Scenario: Performance and user satisfaction
    Given a standard ADR drafting request
    When the agent completes the process
    Then the ADR should be ready within 2 minutes p95
    And user satisfaction (CSAT) should be ≥ 4.6/5
